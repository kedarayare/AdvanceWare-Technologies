The Repository contains 3 Python files for 3 given tasks respectively:

1. Getting data from user ( in this case from 'Random Data' API ) and storing it in a csv file names 'users' [ main.py ]
2. Accessing data of users from 'users.csv', sorting it ( in this case according to username ) and storing it in another csv file named 'users-sorted' [ sorting.py ]
3. Taking username as input and getting details of the user with the entered username. [ getUserData.py ]



A. Main.py:

This file can be simple executed through terminal, and it fetches data from Random-Data API after an interval of 1 second. The output also shows the total no of rows fetched by the code.
